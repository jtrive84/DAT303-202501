    "\n",
    "[Polars](https://pola.rs/) is a high-performance DataFrame library implemented in Rust and designed for use in Python. It is similar to the more widely known pandas library but is optimized for speed and efficiency, particularly with large datasets. Some key features of polars:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance**: Polars is built on Rust, which allows it to take advantage of the language's memory safety and performance benefits. It is often faster than pandas, especially for large data operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lazy Evaluation**: Polars supports lazy evaluation, meaning it doesn't execute operations immediately. Instead, it builds a query plan and executes it only when needed, optimizing the execution path.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-threading**: Polars can utilize multiple CPU cores, making it faster for tasks that can be parallelized.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Due to its efficient memory usage, Polars can handle larger-than-memory datasets more effectively than pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **APIs**: Polars provides a familiar API for users coming from pandas, but it also introduces its own syntax and methods that can take advantage of its unique features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interoperability**: Polars can work alongside pandas and other Python libraries, allowing users to integrate it into existing workflows easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polars is worth exploring as an alternative to pandas, especially for large datasets. In this notebook, we repeat the pandas exercises from *module-02-1.ipynb* but using polars. Refer to the polars [Getting started guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/getting-started/) for background.\n"
